        "Hotel Booking project analysis was done individually by me. As soon as I started exploring hotel booking.csv data file I realised that there are number of columns & rows in dataset. This provided dataset of hotel booking have details of hotel booking,this dataset will help to analyse about booking status and how we can improve booking of hotels considering other factors of booking such as longest stay in hotel, no. of cancellation, when the most hotel booking was done. This will help to understand booking better and can help to take decisions to improve hotel business and make it easy for customer to do booking based on these factors. While analysing dataset, I came to know that there were many null & duplicate values in dataset which made it clear that data cleaning is needed so I removed all the duplicate values, replaced null values with 0 & 'not specified' respectively as per column type.Columns name were renamed. I also dropped rows with 0 count of *babies*,*children* & *adults*. Changed data type of column *children*,*adults*,*babies* into int data type and changed *reservation_status_date* data type into datetime. Created two new columns named as *total_stays* and *total_number_of_guests*. The column *total_stay* is created by adding *stays_in_week_nights* and *stays_in_weekend_nights*  columns, also *total_number_of_guests* column is created by adding *adults*,*children* & *babies* column value.\n",
        "\n",
        "After Data Cleaning, analysis of data is done which gave some important insights from hotel booking data.Some important insights found from hotel booking dataset was about when booking was made, Best time to book hotel, from which country most of the booking was done, busiest month of booking, maximum length of stay in hotel, cancellation rate with respect to both hotels and many more insights about hotel booking were found which can help both hotel business to grow by working on weak factors, and improve services that are negatively effecting hotel business and for customer to make a perfect choice as per their requirements to make booking.\n",
        "\n",
        "For Data visualization, mainly seaborn and matplotlib libraries were used. Types of graph used while visualizing data are bar chart, line chart, pie chart, scatter plot, box plot, correlation heatmap and pair plot. This data visualization gave important and exact details about booking and made the complex data more understandable and easy to view all in one chart."

In the same way, it becomes tough for customers to select a hotel to book as different customer have different requirement while booking hotel. The very first step for business owner towards improvement is analyzing data of our own business to find loopholes and work on various factors to improve booking of hotel.This data can also help customer to find answer of various question wise booking hotels, like when is the best time of year to book a hotel? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? This hotel dataset can help explore those questions!\n",

This data will help to understand which factors effect most of the hotel booking. Analyzing this data based on such factors give clear insights about bookings and help customers to do booking accordingly. We can get various information about booking such as when most hotel bookings were done? From which country most booking were done? Booking based on age group and many more things that will help to draw conclusion what things most be considered while booking a hotel.\n",
